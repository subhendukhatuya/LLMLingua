is team also 6 pointers, = pointers
They 0 throws, and throws count as point so they0= points throws
All together team = points
s opponents scored double his teams number pointers, meaning they scored 50*2=100 points in 2 pointers.
His opponents scored half his team's number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 24/2= 12 points in 3 pointers.
They also scored half Mark's team's points in free throws, meaning they scored 10/2=5 points in free throws.
All together Mark's opponents scored 100+12+5=117 points
The total score for the game is both team's scores added together, so it is 84+117=201 points

Lets think step step
Whenellays5 morebles, she'll have increased the numberbles by 25*0 24
The ofbles she have is 044
Ifella 0bles, and she hases, she has 020es.
Ifella morees, shell have 2/5*30 = 12 more frisbees.
The total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = 42
Bella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = 10 deck cards
If she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she'll have 2/5*10 = 4 more deck cards.
The total number of deck cards she'll have is 10+4 = 14
Together, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = 140 items

If6 and I onanges then I on the other2 types
uming the ofel is W, and knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price and that the price of one apple is A, then 1W=4A
If we know we bought 12 watermelons and 12 apples for $60, then we know that $60 = 12W + 12A
Knowing that 1W=4A, then we can convert the above to $60 = 12(4A) + 12A
$60 = 48A + 12A
$60 = 60A
