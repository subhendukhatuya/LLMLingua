Assistant: 'The United States has a number of different types of sanctions that it can use to achieve its foreign policy goals, including both selective and comprehensive sanctions.

Selective sanctions are targeted at specific individuals or entities that are believed to be engaged in activities that are contrary to US interests. These sanctions can take a variety of forms, including asset freezes, travel bans, and restrictions on financial transactions. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is the US government agency responsible for implementing and enforcing these types of sanctions.

Comprehensive sanctions, on the other hand, are more broadly based and aim to restrict entire sectors of a country's economy or to impose a broad ban on certain types of activities. Comprehensive sanctions can be used to achieve a variety of foreign policy goals, such as punishing a country for human rights abuses or obstructing US foreign policy.

Sectoral sanctions are a type of comprehensive sanction that target specific sectors of a country's economy. These sanctions are intended to have a broader impact on a country's economy and can be used to target key industries such as oil and gas, banking, or transportation. Sectoral sanctions can include restrictions on the import or export of goods or services, as well as restrictions on investment in certain sectors.

Another type of comprehensive sanction is the ban on US exports to a certain country. This type of sanction can be used to punish a country for engaging in activities that are contrary to US interests, such as selling weapons to terrorist groups or engaging in human rights abuses.

It's worth noting that the US has a wide range of tools at its disposal when it comes to imposing economic sanctions, and the specific type of sanction used will depend on the particular situation and the goals of the US government. Additionally, the US may use a combination of different types of sanctions in order to achieve its objectives.'

One type of sanction that the US uses is the visa ban, which restricts the entry of certain individuals into the US. This type of sanction can be used to punish individuals who are believed to be engaged in activities that are contrary to US interests, such as human rights abuses or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Another type of sanction that the US uses is the exclusion from the US financial system. This type of sanction can be used to prevent individuals or entities from accessing the US financial system, which can have a significant impact on their ability to conduct business.

The US can also impose sanctions on foreign governments, organizations, or individuals by imposing restrictions on their ability to access the US market. This can include restrictions on the import or export of goods or services, as well as restrictions on investment in the US.

The US can also use targeted sanctions against specific individuals or entities, such as imposing asset freezes or travel bans on specific individuals or entities.

Another type of sanction that the US uses is the blocking of property and interests in property. This can include the freezing of assets or the prohibition of transactions involving specific property.

Finally, the US can use non-economic sanctions, such as diplomatic isolation, public statements of condemnation, and other measures to isolate or stigmatize a target country or entity.
